  <div class="stackedit__html"><h2 id="redux">Redux</h2>
<p>the most popular implementation of Flux</p>
<p>3 parts of the redux pattern</p>
<ol>
<li>store</li>
<li>reducers</li>
<li>actions</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="application-state">application state</h2>
<ul>
<li>all the info that is displyed and/or available to display on the frontend of an application</li>
<li>when a change is made to an application resource (i.e. CREATE, UPDATE, or DESTROY) the change is persisted to the database on the back-end and updated in state of the front-end</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-use-application-state">why use application state?</h2>
<ul>
<li>minimize api calls to our backend</li>
<li>changes on the webpage that don’t need to be saved to the database</li>
<li>rendering speed avantage</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="flux">Flux</h2>
<ul>
<li>frontend application architecture</li>
<li>unidirectional data flow</li>
<li>store manages the global state of an application, and can only be changed via dispatched actions</li>
<li>note: flux is not specific to react</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="redux-1">Redux</h2>
<ul>
<li>the most popular implementation of the Flux architecture</li>
<li>application state represented as one giant POJO</li>
<li>powerful because of its restrictions</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="redux-principles">Redux Principles</h2>
<ul>
<li>single Source of Truth (application state)</li>
<li>State is read-only</li>
<li>Changes are made with pure functions (reducers)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sample-state-shape">Sample State Shape</h2>
<pre><code>{
	stocks: {
		1: {
			id: 1,
			name: "starbucks",
			ticker: "SBUX",
			price: 31.96
			},
		2: {
			id: 2,
			name: "twitter",
			ticker: "TWTR",
			price: 31.96"
			}
		},
	users: {
		1: {
			},
		2: {
			}
		}
	}
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="file-structure">File Structure</h2>
<ul>
<li>nest entire react app under frontend folder
<ul>
<li>setup entry file inside</li>
<li>same structure that we learned on tuesday with a few new folders
<ul>
<li>components</li>
<li>actions</li>
<li>reducers</li>
<li>store</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="store">Store</h2>
<ul>
<li>Object managing the state of the application</li>
<li>with Redux, we only have one store (other Flux implementations have multiple)</li>
<li>use createStore(RootReducer, [preloadedState], [enhacer]) to build store object
<ul>
<li>we learn about enhacers next week</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>/frontend/store/store.js</p>
<pre><code>import { createStore } from "redux";
// import teasReducer from "../reducers/teasReducer";
import rootReducer from "../reducers/rootReducer"
// const configureStore = (preloadedState = {}) =&gt; { 	
//     return createStore( () =&gt; ({}), preloadedState ) 
// } 
// ^^ w/o reducer
// vv w/ reducer
const configureStore = (preloadedState = {}) =&gt; { 	
//     return createStore( teasReducer, preloadedState ) // example with one reducer 
    return createStore( rootReducer, preloadedState ) // when you have multiple reducers
} 
export default configureStore
</code></pre>
<p>in entry file:</p>
<pre><code>import configureStore from "./store/store"
import {receivedtea} from "./actions/teaActions"
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () =&gt; {
	const store = configureStore();	
	window.store = store; // so you can see it in the console.
	window.teaAction = receivedTea
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="action-creators">Action Creators</h2>
<ul>
<li>functions that return an action
<ul>
<li>an action is an object that has a type property</li>
<li>may also carry a payload</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use action creators to dynamically determine the payload
<ul>
<li>abstract this logic out of components</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use constants for all ‘type’ values</li>
</ul>
<p>frontend/actions/teaAction.js</p>
<pre><code>export const RECEIVED_TEA = "RECEIVED_TEA" // export to use in teas reducer
const receivedGreenTea = {
	type: "RECEIVED_TEA", // can name this whatever, but should be this format
	tea: {
		flavor: "green",
		amount: 5.99,
		id: 1
	}
}
^^ what it looks like ultimately
export const receivedTea = (tea) =&gt; {
    return {
	    type: RECEIVED_TEA,
	    tea: tea // can also just do tea because k v are the same
    }
}
^^ much for dynamic way of writing it
</code></pre>
<h2 id="reducers">Reducers</h2>
<ul>
<li>pure functions that update state based on the action’s type</li>
<li>returns either a new object with the updated state or the same state object ( if it didn’t find a matching case)</li>
<li>RootReducer combines multiple reducers into one using combineReducers
<ul>
<li>each reducer receives every dispatched action, but only deals with it’s own slice of state</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>.dispatch sends the action/oldState to the reducer</li>
</ul>
<p>frontend/reducers/teasReducer.js</p>
<pre><code>import {RECEIVED_TEA} from "../actions/teaActions.js" // do this so you can actually get an error if misspelled
const teasReducer = (oldState = {}, action) =&gt; {
	Object.freeze(oldState); // .freeze is a javascript function that makes it near impossible to mutate oldState
	const newState = Object.assign({}, oldState) // .assign(newObject a.k.a. target, what we're pulling from)
	switch (action.type) {
    	case RECEIVED_TEA:
	    	newState[action.tea.id] = action.tea
			return newState
		default:
			return oldState
	}
}
export default teasReducer
</code></pre>
<p>frontend/reducers/rootReducers.js</p>
<pre><code>import { combineReducers } from "redux";
import teasReducer from "./teasReducer"
import usersReducer from "./usersReducer" // just an example
const rootReducer = combineReducers({
   teas: teasReducer,
   users: usersReducer // just an example
})
export default rootReducers;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="when-is-redux-a-good-idea">When is redux a good idea?</h2>
<ul>
<li>your data changes over time</li>
<li>you want to cache data in memory, but it can change while cached</li>
<li>your data is relational and models include and depend on each other</li>
<li>the same data is assembled from different sources and can be rendered in several places through the UI.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="trade-offs-for-redux">trade-offs for redux</h2>
<ul>
<li>pros
<ul>
<li>makes it easy to reason about complex data and UI changes</li>
<li>complements react well</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>cons
<ul>
<li>boilerplate code</li>
</ul>
</li>
